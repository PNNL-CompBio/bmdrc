    "`bmdrc` is a python library for calculating **B**ench**m**ark **D**ose **R**esponse **C**urves. This tutorial will take users through the library using a dichotomous (binary response) example. `bmdrc` is broken up into five modules \n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Input Data Module:* Import data into the python library.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *Pre-Processing Module:* Combine and remove endpoints as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *Filtering Modules:* Apply recommended filters from the EPA and statistics experts.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. *Model Fitting Modules:* Fit recommended models from the EPA and experts. The best fit model is autoselected for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. *Output Modules:* Select tables to output as csvs. View plots in a HTML report.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, install the package from pip using: \n",
    "\n",
    "`pip install bmdrc`\n",

    "**Dichotomous Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "- *BinaryClass* The `BinaryClass` object contains specific pre-processing and filtering functions that pertain to plates and wells. Each value should be a 0, 1, or NA, and *bmdrc* will caculate the response column. The following columns are needed for data in long and wide format: chemical, plate, well, concentration. The following columns are only needed for data in wide format: endpoint, value. \n",
    "\n",
    "- *ProportionalClass* If your data does not contain plates and wells, the `ProportionalClass` object only requires a chemical, endpoint, concentration, and response (a proportion ranging from 0 to 1). Data must be in long format. \n",
    "\n",
    "- *LPRClass* In the `LPRClass`, larval photomotor response data can be converted to dichotomous as described in [Thomas et al 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468111318300732). Data must be in long format and contain the following columns: chemical, plate, well, concentration, time, and value. Users must specify the time between cycles, the cooldown time between cycles, and whether to start with a light or dark cycle. If this format does not fit your data nicely, please report it to the issues tab. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Continuous Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "- *ContinuousClass* The `ContinuousClass` object requires only four columns: chemical, endpoint, concentration, and response (a continuous variable with any range). All selected models support negative numbers and zeroes. NA values are automatically filtered out. Optionally, an ANOVA can be fit to determine if there's differences in concentrations, with checks to ensure an ANOVA model is appropriate for the given dataset.\n"
